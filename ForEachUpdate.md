This is a note to myself about the tasks to perform for each update.

1. Copy new files from `google/material-design-lite`.
2. Bump version in `package.js`.
3. Run unit tests with `meteor test-packages ./`.
4. Run integration tests:
    1. Navigate into each project.
    2. Update project with `meteor update`.
    3. Run project with `meteor`.
    4. Check test results in browser.
5. Fix bugs if needed.
6. Update change log in `README.md`.
7. Push changes in `master`.
8. Push changes in `release`.
9. Publish with `meteor publish`.
